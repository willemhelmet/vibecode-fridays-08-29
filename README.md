# Vibecode Fridays 08/29 -- Double Dactyl

In this week's vibecode fridays, we experimented with agentic feedback loops using CrewAI.
We created a system to generate [Double Dactl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dactyl) poetry.
From Wikipedia:
> Like the limerick, the double dactyl has a fixed structure, is usually humorous, and is rigid in its prosodic structure. The double dactyl's prosodic requirements are more strenuous due to its increased length, and its specific requirements as to subject matter and word choice much more rigid, making it significantly more difficult to write.

If you want to run this code yourself, you'll need to setup your machine to use `crewai`, [installation instructions here](https://docs.crewai.com/en/installation)!
Additionally, you'll need to create a `.env` file that stores your LLM API key. After all, poetry doesn't grow on trees!
